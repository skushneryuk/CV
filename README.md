### A little bit about myself:
 * Student of Joint Master's program **Math of Machine Learning** at [Skoltech University](https://msc.skoltech.ru/data-science) and [Higher School of Economics (HSE University)](https://www.hse.ru/en/ma/sltheory/)
   * Currently started working on thesis on acceleration of image2image diffusion models under [Alexander Korotin](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=1rIIvjAAAAAJ&hl=en)
 * BSc Applied Mathematics and Computer Science in [MIPT (Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology)](https://mipt.ru/english/)
   * Department of Image Recognition and Text Processing founded by [ABBYY](https://abbyy.com/)
   * Advanced DS-program with in-depth and thorough studies of Classical ML, Deep learning, Mathematical Statistics (AB-test, ANOVA), Time series forecasting, Bayesian Statistics and Generative models, RL, NLP, CV
 * Second grade student at [Yandex School of Data Analysis](https://yandexdataschool.com/), Machine learning developer academic program 

### Working experience
 * Summer 2024 - Internship at [Tinkoff AI Center](https://github.com/tinkoff-ai), Applied NLP Team, as MLE - Python, Pytorch, Transformers.
   * Training of NER models for text anonimization (names, telephone numbers, addresses, etc.)
   * Development of system for text clusterization (project on Semi-supervised clusterization of texts for summer practice at Skoltech)
 * Summer 2022 - Internship at [Meteum.AI team](https://meteum.ai/b2b/home) as MLE - Python, Tensorflow, SQL, etc.
   * Conducting experiments on improvement of short-term precipitation prediction model (nowcasting) with users’ reports
   * Analysis of weather forecasting for business task
 * Summer 2021 - Internship in [Yandex](https://yandex.ru/) ([Yandex.Weather team](https://yandex.com/pogoda/meteum)) as SWE - C++, Go, Python. One can say Yandex is a "Russian Google"
   * Developed 4 new weather scenarios for voice assistant Alice and set up experiments for their AB-testing
 * 2020 - 2021 - Tutor on competitive programming for school students (basic Algorithms and Data Structures, Python, C++) and preparation for school students state exam in maths

### Other experience
 * Took part in several competitive programming contests and different olympiads:
   * 1/2 ICPC (Northern Eurasia Finals)
   * 1/4 ICPC (Moscow Regional Contest)
   * All-Russian university student Olympiad "I am Professional" in Maths (winner)
   * All-Russian university student Olympiad "I am Professional" in AI (medalist)
   * Multiple awards in All-Russian school student Olympiads in Maths, Physics and Programming during school years
 * Experience of using multiple technologies, both from SWE and MLE worlds. All of them are mentioned in my [CV](./CV_English.pdf) ([Russian version](./CV_Russian.pdf))

### My interests:
 * Generative modeling: Diffusion models, GANs
 * Anything with "time":
   * Time series and Random processes, Markov Chains
   * Stochastic analysis and SDEs
   * Their applications in Mathematical finance and Economics
 * Other stuff: competitive programming, functional programming, theoretical ML, maths, etc

### What I am looking for:
 * **TOP PRIORITY: Phd program in Generative AI (Diffusion models, Schrödinger Bridge, Optimal Transport) after graduation from MSc program in 2025**
 * (alternatively) Job after graduation from MSc program
 * Research projects in Generative AI, Diffusion models and Optimal transport
